                <p>
                        Sometimes I feel like
                        I don't have a partner
                        Sometimes I feel like
                        My only friend
                        Is the city I live in
                        The city of angels
                        Lonely as I am
                        Together we cry
                </p>
                <p>
                        I drive on her streets, 'cause
                        She's my companion
                        I walk through her hills, 'cause
                        She knows who I am
                        She sees my good deeds and
                        She kisses me windy
                        I never worry
                        Now that is a lie
                </p>
                <p>
                        I don't ever wanna feel
                        Like I did that day
                        But take me to the place I love
                        Take me all the way
                        I don't ever wanna feel
                        Like I did that day
                        But take me to the place I love
                        Take me all the way
                </p>
                <p>
                        It's hard to believe that
                        There's nobody out there
                        It's hard to believe
                        That I'm all alone
                        At least I have her love
                        The city she loves me
                        Lonely as I am
                        Together we cry
                </p>
                <p>
                        I don't ever wanna feel
                        Like I did that day
                        But take me to the place I love
                        Take me all the way
                        I don't ever wanna feel
                        Like I did that day
                        But take me to the place I love
                        Take me all the way
                 </p>

                        Is where I drew some blood
                        (Under the bridge downtown)
                        I could not get enough
                        (Under the bridge downtown)
                        Forgot about my love
                        (Under the bridge downtown)
                        I gave my life away
                 </p>
