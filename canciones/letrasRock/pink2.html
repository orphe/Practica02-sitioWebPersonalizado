                <h3>Wish You Were Here</h3>
                <p>
                        So, so you think you can tell
                        Heaven from hell?
                        Blue skies from pain?
                        Can you tell a green field
                        From a cold steel rail?
                        A smile from a veil?
                        Do you think you can tell?
                </p>
                <p>
                        Did they get you to trade
                        Your heroes for ghosts?
                        Hot ashes for trees?
                        Hot air for a cool breeze?
                        Cold comfort for change?
                        Did you exchange
                        A walk on part in the war
                        For a lead role in a cage?
                </p>
                <p>
                        How I wish
                        How I wish you were here
                        We're just two lost souls
                        Swimming in a fish bowl
                        Year after year
                        Running over the same old ground
                        What have we found?
                        The same old fears
                        Wish you were here
                </p>
