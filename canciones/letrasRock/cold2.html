                <h3>Yellow</h3>
                <p>
                        Look at the stars
                        Look how they shine for you
                        And everything you do
                        Yeah, they were all yellow
                </p>
                <p>
                        I came along
                        I wrote a song for you
                        And all the things you do
                        And it was called Yellow


                </p>
                <p>
                        So then I took my turn
                        Oh, what a thing to've done
                        And it was all yellow
                </p>
                <p>
                        Your skin
                        Oh, yeah, your skin and bones
                        Turn into something beautiful
                        Do you know
                        You know I love you so?
                        You know I love you so?
                </p>
                <p>
                        I swam across
                        I jumped across for you
                        Oh, what a thing to do
                        'Cos you were all yellow
                    </p>
                    <p>
                            I drew a line
                            I drew a line for you
                            Oh, what a thing to do
                            And it was all yellow
                    </p>
                    <p>
                            And your skin
                            Oh, yeah, your skin and bones
                            Turn into something beautiful
                            Do you know
                            For you I'd bleed myself dry?
                            For you I'd bleed myself dry?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                            It's true
                            Look how they shine for you
                            Look how they shine for you
