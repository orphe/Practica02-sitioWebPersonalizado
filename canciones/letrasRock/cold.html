                <h3>Fix You</h3>
                <p>
                        When you try your best, but you don't succeed
                        When you get what you want, but not what you need
                        When you feel so tired, but you can't sleep
                        Stuck in reverse
                </p>
                <p>
                        And the tears come streaming down your face
                        When you lose something you can't replace
                        When you love someone, but it goes to waste
                        Could it be worse?
                </p>
                <p>
                        Lights will guide to home
                        And ignite your bones
                        And I will try, to fix you
                </p>
                <p>
                        And high up above or down below
                        When you're too in love to let it go
                        But if you never try, you'll never know
                        Just what you're worth
                </p>
                <p>
                        Lights will guide you home
                        And ignite your bones
                        And I will try, to fix you
                        
                        
                    </p>
                    <p>
                            Tears stream down your face
                            When you lose something you cannot replace
                            Tears stream down your face
                            And I
                    </p>
                    <p>
                            Tears stream down your face
                            I promise you I will learn from my mistakes
                            Tears stream down your face
                            And I
                    </p>
                    <p>
                            Lights will guide you home
                            And ignite your bones
                            And I will try to fix you 
                    </p>
