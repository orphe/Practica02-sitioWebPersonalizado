                <h3>Smells Like Teen Spirit</h3>
                <p>
                        Load up on guns, bring your friends
                        It's fun to lose and to pretend
                        She's over-bored and self-assured
                        Oh, no, I know a dirty word
                </p>
                <p>
                        Hello, hello, hello, how low
                        Hello, hello, hello, how low
                        Hello, hello, hello, how low
                        Hello, hello, hello
                </p>
                <p>
                        With the lights out, it's less dangerous
                        Here we are now, entertain us
                        I feel stupid and contagious
                        Here we are now, entertain us
                        A mulatto, an albino
                        A mosquito, my libido
                        Yeah, hey, yay
                </p>
                <p>
                        I'm worse at what I do best
                        And for this gift I feel blessed
                        Our little group has always been
                        And always will until the end
                    </p>
                    <p>
                            Hello, hello, hello, how low
                            Hello, hello, hello, how low
                            Hello, hello, hello, how low
                            Hello, hello, hello
                            
                            
                    </p>

                    <p>
                            And I forget just why I taste
                            Oh yeah, I guess it makes me smile
                            I found it hard, it's hard to find
                            Well, whatever, nevermind
                        </p>
