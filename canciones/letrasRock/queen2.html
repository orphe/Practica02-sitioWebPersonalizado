                <h3>Under Pressure</h3>
                <p>
                        Pressure, pushing down on me
                        Pressing down on you
                        No man ask for
                </p>
                <p>
                        Under pressure
                        That burns a building down
                        Splits a family in two
                        Puts people on streets
                </p>
                <p>
                        Um ba ba be
                        Um ba ba be
                        De day da
                        Ee day da
                        That's okay
                </p>
                <p>
                        It's the terror of knowing
                        What this world is about
                        Watching some good friends
                        Screaming: Let me out
                        Pray tomorrow gets me higher
                        Pressure on people, people on streets
                </p>
                <p>
                        Day day de mm hm
                        Da da da ba ba
                        Okay
                    </p>
                    <p>
                                        
                        Chipping around, kick my brains around the floor
                        These are the days it never rains but it pours
                        Ee do ba be
                        Ee da ba ba ba
                        Um bo bo
                        Be lap
                    </p>
                                            People on streets
                        Ee da de da de
                        People on streets
                        Ee da de da de da de da


                    <p>
    
                            It's the terror of knowing
                            What this world is about
                            Watching some good friends
                            Screaming: Let me out
                    </p>
                    <p>
                            Pray tomorrow gets me higher
                            Higher
                            High
                            Pressure on people, people on streets
                    </p>
                    <p>
                            Turned away from it all like a blind man
                            Sat on a fence but it don't work
                            Keep coming up with love
                            But it's so slashed and torn
                            Why, why, why?
                            Love, love, love, love, love
                    </p>
                    <p>
                            Insanity laughs, under pressure we're breaking
                            Can't we give ourselves one more chance
                            Why can't we give love that one more chance
                            Why can't we give love?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                            Give love, give love, give love
                            Give love, give love, give love
                            Give love, give love
                    </p>
                    <p>
                            'Cause love's such an old fashioned word
                            And love dares you to care for
                            The people on the edge of the night
                            And loves dares you to change our way of
                            Caring about ourselves
                            This is our last dance
                            This is our last dance
                            This is ourselves
                            Under pressure
                            Under pressure
                            Pressure
                    </p>
