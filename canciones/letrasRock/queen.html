                <p>
                        Is this the real life?
                        Is this just fantasy?
                        Caught in a landslide
                        No escape from reality
                </p>
                <p>
                        Open your eyes
                        Look up to the skies and see
                        I'm just a poor boy
                        I need no sympathy
                        Because I'm easy come, easy go
                        Little high, little low
                        Any way the wind blows
                        Doesn't really matter to me
                        To me
                </p>
                <p>
                        Mama, just killed a man
                        Put a gun against his head
                        Pulled my trigger, now he's dead
                        Mama, life had just begun
                        But now I've gone and thrown it all away
                        
                        
                </p>
                <p>
                        Mama! Ooh!
                        Didn't mean to make you cry
                        If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
                        Carry on, carry on
                        As if nothing really matters
                </p>
                <p>
                        Too late, my time has come
                        Sends shivers down my spine
                        Body's aching all the time
                        Goodbye everybody
                        I've got to go
                        Gotta leave you all behind
                        And face the truth
                        
                        
                    </p>
                    <p>
                            Mama! Ooh!
                            (Any way the wind blows)
                            I don't wanna die
                            I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all
                    </p>
                    <p>
                            I see a little silhouetto of a man
                            Scaramouche! Scaramouche!
                            Will you do the fandango?
                            Thunderbolt and lightning
                            Very, very frightening me!
                            Galileo! Galileo!
                            Galileo! Galileo!
                            Galileo, Figaro!
                            Magnifico!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                            I'm just a poor boy and nobody loves me
                            He's just a poor boy from a poor family
                            Spare him his life, from this monstrosity
                    </p>
                    <p>
                            Easy come, easy go
                            Will you let me go?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                            Bismillah!
                            No, we will not let you go!
                            (Let him go!)
                            Bismillah!
                            We will not let you go!
                            (Let him go!)
                            Bismillah!
                            We will not let you go!
                            (Let me go!)
                            Will not let you go!
                            (Let me go!)
                            Never, never let you go!
                            Never, never, never let me go!
                            No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                            Oh, mamma mia, mamma mia!
                            Mamma mia, let me go!
                            Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me!
                            For me!
                            For me!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                            So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye?
                            So you think you can love me and leave me to die?
                            Oh, baby!
                            Can't do this to me, baby!
                            Just gotta get out
                            Just gotta get right outta here!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                            Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                            Nothing really matters
                            Anyone can see
                            Nothing really matters
                            Nothing really matters to me
                    </p>
                    <p>
                            Any way the wind blows
                    </p>
